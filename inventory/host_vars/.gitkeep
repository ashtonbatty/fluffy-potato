# Host-specific variable overrides
#
# Place host-specific YAML files here (e.g., hostname.yml) for edge cases
# that cannot be handled by group_vars.
#
# Variable precedence (highest wins):
#   host_vars/ > group_vars/<service>_servers.yml > group_vars/<tier>.yml > group_vars/all.yml > defaults/main.yml
#
# Best practice: Minimize use of host_vars - prefer group_vars for consistency.
# Only use host_vars for truly unique host configurations.
#
# Example: inventory/host_vars/special-host.example.com.yml
#   ---
#   appname_script_timeout: 900  # This host needs longer timeout
